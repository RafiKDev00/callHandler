I'm worried because last week he forgot he had a doctor's appointment and missed it entirely. I live two hours away so I can't check on him every day. My brother Michael lives closer, his number is 781-555-4421. The visiting nurse comes on Mondays and Wednesdays, her name is Angela from Home Health Plus. Dad's number is 781-555-3308 but honestly, calling me is better, I'll make sure he does what he needs to do. My number is 617-555-9102. His primary care doctor is Dr. Shulman. I'm wondering if there's some kind of medication management service or maybe more frequent home visits? He's very stubborn about maintaining his independence but I'm worried about him being alone. His pharmacy is the Walgreens on Main Street in Quincy, they have all his prescriptions on file.`

    transcript: `[Whispering, nervous] Hi, um, I need to make an appointment. My name is Jessica... Jessica Martinez. Born August 8th, 1990. I hurt my arm and I think I might need it looked at. [Pause] I fell down the stairs. [Longer pause] It's really swollen and I can't move my wrist very well. Um, I need an appointment when my husband is at work, so like between 10am and 2pm on weekdays? [Background noise] Hold on... [Muffled] I'm on the phone with the insurance company! [Back to phone, still whispering] Sorry. Can you call me tomorrow morning, after 9am? That's when he leaves. My number is 214-555-0893 but don't leave a voicemail, just text that there's an appointment available. My friend's number is 214-555-7234, that's Maria, you can call her if you really need to reach me and I don't answer. Please don't mention the doctor's office if my husband picks up. Just say it's a wrong number. [Background: man's voice] I have to go. Thanks.`

    transcript: `[Urgent, worried voice] Hello, I need to speak to Dr. Bennett immediately. This is Richard Torres, I'm calling about my daughter Sophia, her birthday is March 15th, 2008. She's 16. I just found out from her friend that she's been cutting herself. The friend showed me pictures Sophia sent her. I confronted Sophia and she admitted it, she's been doing it for months and hiding it with long sleeves. She says it helps her feel better when she's overwhelmed. She's been struggling at school, her grades dropped, she quit the soccer team, she stays in her room all the time. I thought it was just normal teenager stuff but obviously it's more serious. She's not talking to me now, she's locked in her room. My wife is on her way home from work. I don't know if I should take her to the emergency room or what. She says she doesn't want to kill herself, she just... hurts herself. Is that the same thing? What do I do? Please call me back immediately at 972-555-1847. My wife Angela can also be reached at 972-555-1848. We need help figuring out what to do tonight and then setting up some kind of treatment. She obviously needs more help than we can give her.`
